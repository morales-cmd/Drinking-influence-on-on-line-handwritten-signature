# Drinking-influence-on-online-handwritten-signature
The notebook contains analysis of drinking influence on on-line handwritten signatures. Data on which research was based was collected by the author and his friends during a party. 

The experiment was attended by 9 students. During the experiment each participant was asked to drink 5 shot - glasses of vodka, after each shot - glass he / she had to make 5 on - line signatures on digital WACOM tablet and wait 30 minutes for alchohol to have its effect.

After the party, features were extracted from the signatures (features like mean pen pressure, mean pen point acceleration) and ANOVA was conducetd followed by POST - HOC tests and additional tests of alchohol influence on performance of biometric identification algorithms. Results proved that there is a significant difference between signatures made by a sober and a drunk person.
